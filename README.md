# Landing Page Deployment Automation System: Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop an automated deployment pipeline that provisions AWS resources, deploys a Nuxt boilerplate landing page, and supports multi-environment deployment (staging and production). This system will streamline the creation and management of client landing pages while demonstrating modern cloud engineering practices using Terraform, GitHub Actions, and CLI automation.

### 1.2 Scope

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the automation system. It covers:

- Infrastructure provisioning (S3 buckets, CloudFront distributions, IAM roles/policies).
- A command-line interface (CLI) for initiating deployments.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitHub Actions.
- Support for both staging and production environments.
- Optional integration of monitoring using AWS CloudWatch.

### 1.3 Definitions & Acronyms

- **CLI**: Command-Line Interface.
- **IaC**: Infrastructure as Code.
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment.
- **S3**: Amazon Simple Storage Service.
- **IAM**: Identity and Access Management.
- **Terraform**: An open-source IaC tool for provisioning cloud resources.
- **CloudFront**: AWS content delivery network (CDN).
- **Nuxt**: A framework based on Vue.js for building modern web applications.

## 2. System Overview

The system consists of the following key components:

- **CLI Tool**: A Node.js-based command-line application that prompts the user for project details (name and environment) and triggers subsequent automation steps.
- **Terraform Modules**: IaC scripts that provision and configure AWS resources such as S3 buckets, CloudFront distributions, and IAM roles/policies, with separate configurations for staging and production.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: A set of GitHub Actions workflows that build the Nuxt application, deploy it to the appropriate AWS environment, and invalidate CloudFront caches for fast content delivery.
- **Monitoring (Optional)**: Basic CloudWatch dashboards and alarms to monitor application health and performance.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 CLI Tool

- **FR1**: The CLI must prompt the user for the project name.
- **FR2**: The CLI must allow the user to select the deployment environment (staging or production).
- **FR3**: Upon receiving input, the CLI must trigger the Terraform scripts to provision the necessary AWS resources.
- **FR4**: The CLI should log the progress and results of each automation step.

### 3.2 Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)

- **FR5**: Provision an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting for the landing page.
- **FR6**: Create a CloudFront distribution that uses the S3 bucket as its origin.
- **FR7**: Create and attach an IAM role with a least-privilege policy that allows CI/CD deployments to the S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution.
- **FR8**: Support separate configurations for staging and production environments using Terraform workspaces or separate state files.

### 3.3 CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

- **FR9**: Automatically build the Nuxt application upon code changes.
- **FR10**: Deploy the build output to the appropriate S3 bucket based on the selected environment.
- **FR11**: Invalidate the CloudFront cache to ensure the latest content is served.
- **FR12**: Output a staging URL that can be shared with clients for QA.
- **FR13**: Securely manage AWS credentials, leveraging OIDC-based role assumption if possible.

### 3.4 Monitoring (Optional)

- **FR14**: Provision basic CloudWatch dashboards and alarms to monitor the health and performance of the deployed landing page.
- **FR15**: Include a post-deployment validation step that checks the accessibility and performance of the landing page.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1 (Scalability)**: The system must support rapid provisioning of multiple client landing pages without manual intervention.
- **NFR2 (Security)**: Follow the principle of least privilege; use secure, temporary credentials (e.g., via OIDC) and avoid long-lived static keys.
- **NFR3 (Reliability)**: Ensure that the automation scripts include error handling and rollback mechanisms in case of failures.
- **NFR4 (Maintainability)**: Code should be modular, well-documented, and version-controlled to facilitate future enhancements.
- **NFR5 (Performance)**: Deployments should complete within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 10 minutes for typical configurations).

## 5. Assumptions and Constraints

### 5.1 Assumptions

- The developer has access to an AWS account with sufficient permissions.
- AWS CLI, Node.js, and Terraform are installed on the developerâ€™s machine.
- GitHub Actions workflows will be configured with necessary secrets and environment variables.

### 5.2 Constraints

- The solution is initially focused on automating the backend infrastructure and deployment pipeline; the Nuxt frontend logic is out of scope for the first version.
- All AWS resources must be provisioned in a specified AWS region (e.g., us-east-1) unless otherwise configured.
- The project must support a seamless switch between staging and production environments.

## 6. Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Automated Deployment Initialization

- **Actor**: DevOps Engineer
- **Scenario**: The engineer runs the CLI tool, inputs the project name, and selects "staging." The system then provisions the AWS resources, deploys the Nuxt landing page, and outputs the staging URL for client QA.
- **Outcome**: A fully deployed staging environment is ready for client review.

### Use Case 2: Production Deployment

- **Actor**: DevOps Engineer
- **Scenario**: After QA on the staging environment, the engineer re-runs the CLI tool, selects "production," and the system deploys the landing page to the production environment with stricter security and monitoring settings.
- **Outcome**: A fully automated, production-ready landing page is deployed.

## 7. Future Enhancements

- **FE1**: Integration of more advanced monitoring tools and automated alerts.
- **FE2**: Automated rollback procedures in case of deployment failures.
- **FE3**: Expansion of the CLI tool to support additional deployment configurations and customizations.
- **FE4**: Detailed logging and analytics for each deployment phase.
